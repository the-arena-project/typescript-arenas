Write a function called reverseString that takes a string and returns a reversed string without modifying the original string.

For this exercise, the [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) is not allowed.

The function will be prototyped in the following way:

```typescript
type ReverseStringFn = (str: string) => string
```

Usage example:

```typescript
const str = "123"

reverseString(str)
// "321"
print(str)
// "123"
```
