Write a function called `getHeight` that returns the height of a node in your binary tree.

The height of a node is the maximum depth of that node to a leaf.

A tree with a single node has a height of 0.

A null node has a height of -1.

Your function should conform to the following prototype:

```typescript
type GetHeightFn = (root: BNode | null) => number
```
