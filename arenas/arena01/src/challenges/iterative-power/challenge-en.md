Warning: for this exercise, using the ** operator of TypeScript is forbidden.

Write a function iterativePower that calculates nb raised to the power of power.

You must consider the following constraints:

nb >= 0

power >= 0

Your function must be iterative and conform to the following prototype:

```typescript
type PowerFn = (nb: number, power: number) => number
```
