Write a function arrLength that returns the length of an array of numbers.

For the time being, we will consider that an array T ends when its element T[n] is equal to the value undefined for any n >= 0.

Your function should conform to the following prototype:

```typescript
type ArrLengthFn = (arr: number[]) => number
```
