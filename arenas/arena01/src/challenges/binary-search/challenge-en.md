Write a function called binarySearch that replicates the behavior of Array.find.

If the element is found, it is returned; otherwise, the function returns undefined.

For this exercise, you will implement a binary search algorithm.

Your function should conform to the following prototype:

```typescript
type SearchFn = (arr: number[], value: number) => number | undefined
```
