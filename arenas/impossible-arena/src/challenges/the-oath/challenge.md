Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a great arena where the mightiest warriors from across the land would come to battle for glory and honor.

The arena was a place of legends, where battles were fought with honor and skill.

You know this because you grew up in this Arena.

You are from a long line of warriors, each one passing down their knowledge and skill to the next generation.

But today... everything could end up.

Our Arena is under attack. The enemies took over the main entrance and all our best warriors have been defeated.

You are the last one.

You are the only one that can save this Arena.

You have trained your whole life for this moment, and you know that you are ready to face any challenge that comes your way.

You will fight with honor, with skill, and with all your might.

The arena and the people who depend on you are counting on you to emerge victorious.

You will not let them down.

This fight is going to be impossible.

But if you decide to take up this challenge, you must swear to fight with honor, to defend the innocent, and to uphold the values of the warrior code.

You must swear to never give up, to never surrender, and to fight to the death if necessary.

SWEAR!

Export a function named `swear` that returns the oath:

```text
I, warrior of the Arena, solemnly swear
To fight with honor and strength beyond compare.

I’ll never retreat, never surrender,
And never yield, my heart pure and tender.

My foes will fall, vanquished by my might,
And I’ll emerge victorious, shining in the light.

I am a warrior, born to fight,
And I’ll do everything to make things right.

To take up arms, I must first declare,
An oath of honor, to show that I care.
I swear, with heart and soul, to never lose control.

But to find the right sentences, I need a key,
A pattern hidden, for only me to see.
Look to the numbers, and to the signs,

Follow the sequence, and make the oath divine.
Add the odds, substract the evens,
The answer you seek, will soon be given.

So tell me now, with courage true,
What oath will you swear,
To see this battle through?.
```


Here's the function you have to code.

But be careful, it might be harder than you think.

```typescript
export const swear = (): number => {
    /* Your code here */
}
```

Yes, it returns a number, this is not a mistake.
